# National-Parks-Search

## User Story

As an outdoor enthusiast, I want to be able to search a database of national parks to be able to plan
a roadtrip and view available activities in the area and their locational relationship from potential parks to visit.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a database of national parks
When I search Colorado in the navigation bar
Then I expect to be displayed a list of national parks within Colorado  
Given a list of national parks within Colorado (or specified state)
When I select a specific park
Then I expect to see a list of asssociated activities
Given a list of activites associated with a park
When I select a specific activity
Then I expect to see a navigation tool (Waze) to help navigate from the selected park to the activity

## Description

The motivation for this projet was to design an application for searching national parks and associated activities,
built by a team collectively and integrating at least two external APIs.
The desire for such an application was centered around the need to access information effectively, and intuitively per the user's preferences.
This application serves as a tool to integrate databases into one, easy-to-use, application combining national park locations per-state, and associated activities
near and around the national park the user searched for.
This project helped to strengthen the use of vanilla js and jQuery, bootstrap design, sematic HTML elements, and most importantly; teamwork, communication and git-flow.
